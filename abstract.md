Abstract | CKME 136-XA0



##Context



This project will look at the phenomena of '[astroturfing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astroturfing)' in publicly accessible web comments and reviews. In other words it is about fraud detection.



##Problem Domain



It is not uncommon for product owners to 'buy' favourable reviews, likes, and comments on the open internet. The aim is to either drown out unfavourable mentions or completely misrepresent the 'grass roots' nature of the commentary. 



This project will look for...



1. illegitimate reviews 

2. illegitimate reviewers

3. legitimate reviews by legitimate reviewers that are oddly timed... i.e., that were likely solicited en-masse



##Dataset





[35 million Amazon reviews collected by Stanford](https://snap.stanford.edu/data/web-Amazon.html)



##Technique(s)



Text classification together with anomaly detection.



##Tools



- Bayes

- KNN

- Python
